Sometimes mount.lfs failed, in the checking (fsck) part with strange
error message such as

 - ill formed message
 - input value bad format
 - assert_equal
 - or even segmentation fault.

This is especially true when managing more than 10 000 files. I dont
know why, but it seems related to berkeley DB as there is no bug while
using gdbm. Nevertheless, relaunch and pray and at some times it
should work (that works for me at least). You can also use -nofsck.
This problem never was a real problem for me while using LFS in
real mode. It is an even less important problem in the semi real mode.
